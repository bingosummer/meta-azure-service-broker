# Azure Storage Blob Service

[Azure Storage Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/) offers reliable, economical cloud storage for data big and small. This broker currently publishes a single service and plan for provisioning Azure Storage Blob Service.

## Create an Azure storage blob service

1. Get the service name and plans

  ```
  cf marketplace
  ```

  Sample output:

  ```
  service                       plans                     description
  azure-storageblob             default                   Azure Storage Blob Service
  ```

  If you can not find the service name, please use the following command to make the plans public.

  ```
  cf enable-service-access azure-storageblob
  ```

2. Create a service instance

  ```
  cf create-service azure-storageblob $service_plan $service_instance_name
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  cf create-service azure-storageblob default myblobservice
  ```

  Additional configuration parameters are supported with the provision request. These parameters are passed in a valid JSON object containing configuration parameters, provided either in-line or in a file. If these parameters are not provided, the broker will create the resources according to [Naming Conventions](#naming-conventions).

  ```
  cf create-service azure-storageblob $service_plan $service_instance_name -c $path_to_parameters
  ```

  Supported configuration parameters:

  ```
  {
    "resource_group_name": "<resource-group-name>",
    "storage_account_name": "<storage-account-name>",
    "location": "<location>",
    "account_type": "<account-type>"
  }
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  cf create-service azure-storageblob default myblobservice -c /tmp/config.json
  ```

  The contents of `/tmp/config.json`:

  ```
  {
    "resource_group_name": "myResourceGroup",
    "storage_account_name": "mystorageaccount",
    "location": "eastus",
    "account_type": "Standard_LRS"
  }
  ```

3. Check the operation status of creating the service instance

  The creating operation is asynchronous. You can get the operation status after the creating operation.

  ```
  cf service $service_instance_name
  ```

  For example:

  ```
  cf service myblobservice
  ```

## Using the services in your application

### Format of Credentials

The credentials provided in a bind call have the following format:

```
"credentials":{
  "container_name": "cloud-foundry-2eac2d52-bfc9-4d0f-af28-c02187689d72",
  "primary_access_key": "PRIMARY-ACCOUNT-KEY",
  "secondary_access_key": "SECONDARY-ACCOUNT-KEY",
  "storage_account_name": "ACCOUNT-NAME"
}
```

### Demo Applications

[Azure Storage Consumer](https://github.com/bingosummer/azure-storage-consumer) is a simple example to use the service.

In the application, you can use Azure SDK for Python to operate your storage account (e.g. put or get your blobs).

1. Get the credentials from the environment variables

  ```
  service_name = 'azure-storageblob'
  vcap_services = json.loads(os.environ['VCAP_SERVICES'])
  account_name = vcap_services[service_name][0]['credentials']['storage_account_name']
  account_key = vcap_services[service_name][0]['credentials']['primary_access_key']
  ```

2. Create the blob service using the credentials

  ```
  from azure.storage import BlobService
  blob_service = BlobService(account_name, account_key)
  ```

  If you would like to create a blob service in Azure China Cloud, you need to specify `host_base` in `BlobService`.

>**NOTE:** The demo is based on `azure==0.11.1`. If you would like to use the lastest `azure-storage-python`, please refer to [azure-storage-python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python).

### Binding

1. Build the demo application

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/bingosummer/azure-storage-consumer
  cd azure-storage-consumer
  cf push --no-start
  ```

2. Bind the service instance to the application

  ```
  cf bind-service azure-storage-consumer myblobservice
  ```

3. Restart the application

  ```
  cf restart azure-storage-consumer
  ```

4. Show the service instance

  ```
  cf services
  ```

5. Verify that the credentials are set as environment variables

  ```
  cf env azure-storage-consumer
  ```

## Unbind and delete the service instance

1. Unbind the application from the service instance

  ```
  cf unbind-service azure-storage-consumer myblobservice
  ```

2. Delete the service instance

  ```
  cf delete-service myblobservice -f
  ```

## Naming Conventions

A service provisioning call will create Azure Storage Account.

The following names are used and can be customized with a prefix:

Resource         | Name is based on     | Custom Prefix Environment Variable  | Default Prefix    | Example Name  
-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------
Azure Resource Group | service instance ID | RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_PREFIX | cloud-foundry- | cloud-foundry-2eac2d52-bfc9-4d0f-af28-c02187689d72
Azure Storage Account | part of service instance ID | STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME_PREFIX | cf | cf2eac2d52bfc94d0faf28c0
Azure Storage Containers | service instance ID | CONTAINER_NAME_PREFIX | cloud-foundry- | cloud-foundry-2eac2d52-bfc9-4d0f-af28-c02187689d72
